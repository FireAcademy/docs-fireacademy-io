# Grants

We understand how hard it is to build the Chia ecosystem. One time, we [shut down everything for a month](https://twitter.com/fireacademyio/status/1583590565803065344) to save some money. We've applied to the Chia Cultivation Grant Program (can you see us [here](https://www.chia.net/grants/)? exactly.). We're trying to 'make it' in the Chia ecosystem right now.



With this in mind, we created the FireAcademy.io Grants Program to support fellow teams or individual developers that want to build something in the Chia ecosystem.
