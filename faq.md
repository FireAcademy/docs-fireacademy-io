## I'm having trouble with the dashboard.

## I'm having trouble using one of your APIs.

## Why should I trust you with my credit card details?

You shouldn't. FireAcademy.io uses Stripe for billing - we don't handle the data and risk being banned if we do something fishy. Also, you can find out where I leave pretty easily.

## Don't you care about decentralization?

We do - that's why we chose the Chia blockchain in the first place! We do think, however, that an Infura-like provider will exist anyway for a variety of reasons. Things are just simpler this way. We do think there's a lot of value in making developers' lives easier with our service. However, we want to do it the 'right way': everything that powers our service is open-source and we can help you make your own cluster any time.&#x20;

## Open-source?

Yes! You can find our repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/fireacademy).
