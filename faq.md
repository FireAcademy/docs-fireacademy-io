# FAQ

## How do I sign up for an Enterprise plan?

We're dedicated in meeting all of our clients' needs. The Enterprise plan is perfect for customers with specific needs - whether you need a limit of 100,000 API keys, a lot of traffic each month, or lower prices for extra credits, we can create a plan that is taylored to your needs. Please [contact us ](contact-us.md)directly to sign up or ask any questions about our offering.

## Why should I trust you with my credit card details?

You shouldn't. FireAcademy.io uses Stripe for billing - we don't handle the data and risk being banned if we do something fishy. Also, you can find out where I leave pretty easily.

## Don't you care about decentralization?

We do - that's why we chose the Chia blockchain in the first place! We do think, however, that an Infura-like provider will exist anyway for a variety of reasons. But we are committed to doing it the 'right way': everything that powers our service is open-source and we can help you configure your own cluster any time.&#x20;

## Open-source?

Yes! You can find our repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/fireacademy).
