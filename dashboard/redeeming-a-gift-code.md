# Redeeming a Gift Code

Once logged in to the [FireAcademy.io Dashboard](https://dashboard.fireacademy.io), you can redeem gift codes by pressing on the drop-down showing your email address in the upper righ corner of the page and selecting 'Use Gift Code'. When redeeming a gift code, you will be asked to provide 1 things:

## Gift Code

The code that you want to redeem. This is an UUIDv4 string and should look something like this:

> 405dc08f-d6ce-4b44-b7ea-98770104eaac

## A Note About Credit Expirations

Credits redeemed though a gift code expire at the end of your current billing cycle, which is shown on the dashboard.
