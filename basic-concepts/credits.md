# Credits

Each request to Leaflet consumes a preset amount of credits (420) from the API key owner's account. Credits are billed each week at a known rate ($1 = 4200000 credits).

One could think of our credit system as an abstraction layer. Instead of billing for the number of requests made to Leaflet, we chose to go this route to make future product integrations easier.

Something very important to mention is that credits can also be obtained via gift codes, which can be given at the discretion of the almighty admin.
